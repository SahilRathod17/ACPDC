Fetch students marks from scan copy of marksheet using Optical Character Recognition(OCR).

Synopsis!

At ACPDC thousands of students apply for diploma admission. In this registration process students need to fill marks in form even though 
the marksheet is already uploaded. Also, The scanned image of student which is uploaded is not verified at the upload time. To remove all 
this problems, We design our model.

Our model, extract marks automatically from scanned copy of marksheet which is uploaded by students in the form and also verify that the 
uploaded image is of a particular person or not by face recognition.

The weakness of our model is, If the quality of uploaded scanned copy of marksheet is not good, then the marks are not collected accurately 
and the thread is, If the file not uploaded in the proper format then the OCR doesn`t work. 

The Tools & Technologies which are used in this model are,
                
                
       Database - MySQL
       Backend - Flask
       Backend language - python
       Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
       Design – Figma

There are two stakeholders of this model, 

 1) Student: - Fill the form for the admission process 
 
 2) ACPDC: - Access the data which is already collected from the filled forms and stored in the database for the further process. 
 
 3) Institute :- Access the students information which are enrolled in their institute.
